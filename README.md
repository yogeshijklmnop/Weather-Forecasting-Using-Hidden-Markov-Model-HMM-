# Weather-Forecasting-Using-Hidden-Markov-Model-HMM-

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** to analyze and predict weather patterns using historical meteorological data. By leveraging probabilistic state modeling, the model identifies weather transitions and trends over time.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Utilizes **HMM** for state-based weather prediction.
- Processes historical weather data with **feature engineering** techniques.
- Implements **time-series clustering** for state identification.
- Evaluates model accuracy using real-world datasets.
- Visualizes weather trends and transitions for better interpretability.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The project uses **Seattle Weather Dataset**, which includes:
- Date-wise weather observations.
- Temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- Data preprocessed for enhanced feature extraction.
